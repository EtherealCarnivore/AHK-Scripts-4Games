;WARNINGS/Potential Issues/Recommendations
;Potential Issue: 	Having Title Bar turned off will create a shift in the Y values and Scrit wont be able find several Locations (Jadisero)
;Warning:			May need to Enable Hide Completed/Lock options on the Adventure Select Window (code scrolls list to top and expects Mad Wizard option to be visible)
;Warning:			Pausing Script while on Boss Level will throw off the Level Counter
;					(while script should still work may run an extra level and Leveling Champs/ClickDmg will be out of sync for that run)
;Recommended:		Pause Script prior to opening in game windows (store/high rollers/etc)
